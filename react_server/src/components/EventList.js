description: "Please join facilitator Maryse Cardin for a workshop that will focus on self-talk for stress reduction. Come learn self-talk tools that will help you feel less pressure and a greater sense of calm and wellbeing. The workshop is on September 18 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and will be held at Silhouette Studio, 2050 Nelson St., Vancouver (next to Stanley Park). This will be a small group setting with limited space and registration is required. To register, please e-mail: selftalklove@gmail.com or visit the website: www.selftalklove.com. The cost of this workshop is $65. Maryse Cardin has a masterâ€™s degree in communication and has worked at several universities, where she conducted research into the power of self-talk. Her workshops combine elements from intrapersonal communication theory, psychology, sports psychology, coaching, Zen Buddhism and other positive-thinking approaches. She combines positive self-talk with physical movement to help clients and workshop participants to transform limiting beliefs and live their best life.",
