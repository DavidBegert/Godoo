React.js
=============
Godoo is an app written purely in React.js that allows a user to choose a location (using geolocation or by entering a valid place) and the app will show a map with all the events happening near that place. The user can then filter the events to his choosing based on categories and distance away, or can just browse all the events. Once an event is chosen, the user can add it to their google calendar at the click of a button.  

##Getting Started
